# Site scaffold

This folder contains a lightweight static site scaffold you can use as a personal portfolio.

- Replace the placeholder resume: add your PDF as `site/assets/resume.pdf` and update links.
- Replace the headshot: add your photo as `site/assets/headshot.jpg` and update `index.html`/`about.html` if needed.
- To preview locally, open `site/index.html` in your browser.
- To publish on GitHub Pages: push this `site/` folder to a branch (e.g., `gh-pages`) or use the repository settings to serve `/site` as the Pages root.

If you want, I can:

- Add your resume and headshot to the scaffold (you can upload them here).
- Initialize a minimal GitHub Pages workflow and commit the files.
